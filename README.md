# What is Six Monitor?

**Six Monitor** is a personal terminal-based resource monitor that visually displays your **CPU**, **RAM**, and **Disk** usage using ASCII-based graphics. It aims to provide a clear and interactive way to track system performance *without ever leaving the terminal*.

This is an evolving project and will continue to receive improvements over time.

# Coming Soon...

1. Colored circles for better visualization. 
2. CPU temperature and top-running processes. 
3. More detailed memory stats. 
4. A main menu screen on launch. 
5. Code refactoring for modularity and security.
